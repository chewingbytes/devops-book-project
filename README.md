K-pop Demon Hunters is an animated film about a popular K-pop girl group named Huntr/x who are secretly demon hunters using their music and performances to protect the world from evil. The film blends K-pop, action, and fantasy, featuring the group as they fight supernatural threats like soul-stealing demons and a rival boy band, while also dealing with internal struggles of identity, fame, and self-acceptance. The story draws on Korean mythology, modernizing the role of female shamans to create a contemporary narrative about fighting for what's right.  

The basic plot
The K-pop group Huntr/x (Rumi, Mira, and Zoey) are secretly the latest in a long line of demon hunters. 
For centuries, trios of hunters have used their music to create a magical barrier called the Honmoon to protect the world from demons. 
Their goal is to strengthen the Honmoon into the "Golden Honmoon," which will banish demons permanently. 
Rumi, the group's leader, is secretly half-demon, which causes her to lose her voice as her demonic patterns spread. 
She hopes a new single will turn the Honmoon gold to cure her, but a rival K-pop boy band, the Saja Boys, emerges to weaken the barrier for their demonic leader
